Simple dungeon hunter game made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

# Game Guide
I think that this game is pretty self explainatory in the way it is presented to the user at the start. Some things worth knowing:

1. Your starting weapon for the game is a stick, through the store section you can purchase better weapons and deal more damage. 
2. When purchasing weapons, you can no longer buy weapons after you have gotten the sword (it is the strongest weapon).
3. After purchasing the sword, you can sell your other weapons, starting from stick and moving upward by pressing the purchase weapons button located in the store section of the game.
4. After defeating the dragon the game is completed, you can then start over and choose a different aproach to play the game or quit:).

# Note
The game will further improve with bigger screen coverage and usage of better features such as more weapons, more monsters, better looking layout and pictures that represent what part of the "world" you currently are in and what monster you are fitghting during the fighting sequence of the game.
